# Micromotion app prototypes

More about the apps [here](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/micro/subprojects/apps/)


In the micromotion apps, we use accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data from the phone to detect tiny changes in movement. The user is supposed to hold the phone in his/her hand, and by doing different kinds of gesture, the user creates music in different kinds of ways.

The prototypes must be opened on android or iPhone to work, and can be reached from these two links: 

* [prototype 1](https://fractionmari.github.io/micro/)

* [prototype 2](https://fractionmari.github.io/micro/prototype3.html)

### Sverm

The apps are related to the micromotion Sverm instruments which were an artistic research project by Alexander R. Jensenius and Kari Anne Vadstensvik Bjerkestrand, investigating standstill and micromotion in the context of a dance performance.

Made by Mari Lesteberg, after an idea by Alexander R. Jensenius, spring 2021
